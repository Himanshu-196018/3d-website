        NFTs are currently taking the digital art and collectibles world by
        storm. Digital artists are seeing their lives change thanks to huge
        sales to a new crypto-audience. And celebrities are joining in as they
        spot a new opportunity to connect with fans. But digital art is only one
        way to use NFTs. Really they can be used to represent ownership of any
        unique asset, like a deed for an item in the digital or physical realm.

        If Andy Warhol had been born in the late 90s, he probably would have
        minted Campbell's Soup as an NFT. It's only a matter of time before Nike
        puts a run of Jordans on Ethereum. And one day owning your car might be
        proved with an NFT.
